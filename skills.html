    <div class="page-info"> <!-- My Skillset -->
        <div class="languages"> <!-- Programming languages I've learnt -->
            <h2>Languages I've learnt and my confidence in them</h2>
            <div class="html"> <!-- HTML -->
                The language I have the most confidence in for Web Design, is HTML. I feel like I have a
                great understanding on how everything should be ordered in a html file, and what should be used at the
                correct time
            </div>
            <div class="css"> <!-- CSS -->
                The next language, is something I am a little confident with, but not completely, which is
                CSS. I have brought this one up second, as it always goes with HTML. It can take me a little while to
                get a website looking how I want it with CSS, but I always get where I want to in the end.
            </div>
            <div class="javascript"> <!-- JavaScript -->
                Onto the next language, and one that I have a lot of joy using, is JavaScript. I
                have a bit more confidence in my use of JavaScript than I do in my use of CSS, however, it can still
                take me a little while to get things right, but I often end up able to figure out what went wrong and
                fixing the issue.
            </div>
            <div class="python"> <!-- Python -->
                Python is the language I have the second least confidence in. I struggle to figure out
                how to make the back end of a website work, however, I would like to improve this skill so that I can be
                as helpful as I can in a web development environment.
            </div>
            <div class="c-sharp"> <!-- C Sharp -->
                C sharp is a language that is self taught, so is therefore something I don't have much
                confidence in. However, I would love to improve my knowledge of C sharp, as I think it'd improve my web
                development and help me in the future too.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="frameworks"> <!-- Frameworks I've learnt about -->
            <h2>Frameworks I know about and my confidence in them</h2>
            <div class="bootstrap"> <!-- Bootstrap (CSS Framework) -->
                Bootstrap is something I have a lot of joy using, and a lot of understanding in when
                to use the framework.
            </div>
            <div class="django"> <!-- Django (Python Framework) -->
                Django is a framework that I don't have a lot of confidence in at all. This is due to
                not understanding how to create a model very well. This is one framework that I'd really like to improve
                on as much as possible, as it'll also help me to create an API with the Django Rest Framework.
