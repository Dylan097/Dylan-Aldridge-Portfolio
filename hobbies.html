        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>This is a list of things that I enjoy to do outside of work. These are things that I don't do every week when
            I'm not working, like what was explained in my about me page, but things that I just enjoy doing from time
            to time</p>
        <div class="football"> <!-- Football -->
            <h3>Football</h3>
            <p>I enjoy playing football with some of my friends on a Thursday, and hope to be able to play more often
                than
                I currently do, as I'm unable to play every week. I've also looked into playing with a 5-a-side team on
                a
                Monday, to better my chances at playing more often.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paintball"> <!-- Paintballing -->
            <h3>Paintball</h3>
            <p>Something else I enjoy, which I do far less often, is paintball. Ever since I first went paintballing, I
                knew I enjoyed this tactical game, but I often find myself unable to make the time to do it, as well as
                unable to find people to go with. However, I would love to alter this in the future, if it's possible
                for
                me.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="gaming"> <!-- Gaming -->
            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>I also enjoy playing video games from time to time. This is another thing that I've find less and less
                time
                for over the years, but when I do play, I like to play games like Fifa, Call Of Duty and Hogwarts
                Legacy.
                There is a pool of other games that I enjoy playing from time to time, but these are the main ones that
                I
                play when I get the time.</p>
