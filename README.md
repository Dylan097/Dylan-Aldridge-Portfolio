## Title

In the title, I have displayed my name and contact information. As I am doing a mobile first approach to this portfolio, at this point of the project, this information is only displayed at the top of the website for users to access.

The point of this, is to make sure mobile users get the best experience possible when accessing the website from their mobile device.

## Navigation

The navigation bar is simple, but effective. The design I have chosen, makes the user aware that the Navigation section is different to the rest of the content of the page, and also makes sure the user knows what page they're currently on, making use of different classes to make it clear where the user is on the page. I've also made sure that any user is redirected to a new page whenever they click on the *My CV* tab, so that they can return to the website and keep my CV up at the same time.

## About Me Page

In my about me page, I talk about how I like to work, what I do outside of work and what I've done in my working career.

### How I work

In this section, I've explained how I like to try and work in my current working environment, and what type of environments I've worked in throughout my career.

### Outside work

In this section, I've explained what I do outside of work, in my normal day to day life.

### Goals

Here, I've explained what my ideal path will be for the future of my career. This isn't necessarily what will happen in my future, as you never know what lies ahead.

### My Career

I have explained in detail here what I've done in my career, and the tasks that I had been trained in at each job. I have also explained what skills I can take into my next job.

## Website plans

Now that I've completed work on the about me page, I plan on moving onto the skills page, where I'll display what programming languages I know, whether I have a basic understanding in them, or have a more advanced understanding of them. This section will also contain any frameworks I might have knowledge about, including bootstrap and django.

Once I have completed the skills page, I then plan on working on my hobbies page. This will include any hobbies that I do. These aren't necessarily things that I do every week, but things I enjoy doing with my friends or on my own.

Once this has been complete, I will then work on optimising the page for desktop, which will have an almost completely different layout to the view I'm currently working on, which is the mobile view.
