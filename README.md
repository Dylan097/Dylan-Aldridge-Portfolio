## Title

In the title, I have displayed my name and contact information. As I am doing a mobile first approach to this portfolio, at this point of the project, this information is only displayed at the top of the website for users to access.

The point of this, is to make sure mobile users get the best experience possible when accessing the website from their mobile device.

## Navigation

The navigation bar is simple, but effective. The design I have chosen, makes the user aware that the Navigation section is different to the rest of the content of the page, and also makes sure the user knows what page they're currently on, making use of different classes to make it clear where the user is on the page. I've also made sure that any user is redirected to a new page whenever they click on the *My CV* tab, so that they can return to the website and keep my CV up at the same time.

## About Me Page

In my about me page, I talk about how I like to work, what I do outside of work and what I've done in my working career.

### How I work

In this section, I've explained how I like to try and work in my current working environment, and what type of environments I've worked in throughout my career.

### Outside work

In this section, I've explained what I do outside of work, in my normal day to day life.

### Goals

Here, I've explained what my ideal path will be for the future of my career. This isn't necessarily what will happen in my future, as you never know what lies ahead.

### My Career

I have explained in detail here what I've done in my career, and the tasks that I had been trained in at each job. I have also explained what skills I can take into my next job.

On the Hobbies Page, I've explained what I enjoy doing outside of work that I don't do weekly, but enjoy doing from time to time. These are things that, if given the opportunity, I would love to do more of than I currently do.

## Mobile View

The mobile view of the website takes up the entire width of the screen. I made the decision to only have the nav bar shown on screen at all times in this view, so that the user can navigate through the pages at any point on each page, whilst still seeing as much info on screen as possible.

## Desktop View

The desktop view of the website has my name and contact info in full view whilst scrolling through the website on the left hand side of the website. As well as this, on the right hand side of the website, which takes up most of the screen size, I have put at the top of the screen what page the user is on in large letters. The navigation also stays within view of the page at all times, so that the pages can be navigated throughtout page viewing.
