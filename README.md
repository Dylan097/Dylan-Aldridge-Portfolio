## Title

### Complete

In the title, I have displayed my name and contact information. As I am doing a mobile first approach to this portfolio, at this point of the project, this information is only displayed at the top of the website for users to access.

The point of this, is to make sure mobile users get the best experience possible when accessing the website from their mobile device.

### Future Plans

I intend to fully focus on the mobile version of this website, before looking at the design of the desktop version, which will have a different layout to what is shown on the mobile version

## Navigation

### Complete

The navigation bar is simple, but effective. The design I have chosen, makes the user aware that the Navigation section is different to the rest of the content of the page, and also makes sure the user knows what page they're currently on, making use of different classes to make it clear where the user is on the page. I've also made sure that any user is redirected to a new page whenever they click on the *My CV* tab, so that they can return to the website and keep my CV up at the same time.

### Future Plans

With the navigation design complete for mobile view, I also intend on slightly changing the position of the navigation in the desktop view. This decision is to make sure that the mobile view can see as much as possible on the page, without the experience being affected, but also, so that the desktop view can see more information at all times, whether they're scrolling down the page, or at the top of the page. Due to my design choice, mobile users will only be able to see my contact information when they're at the top of the page, so that their screen isn't cluttered with information, and so that the page is more readable.
