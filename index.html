        <div class="work-ethics"> <!-- How I Work -->
            <h2>How do I work?</h2>
            <p>When I'm working, I like to focus on the task at hand, and get it done as quickly as I possibly can,
                whilst also doing the job as trained.</p>
            <p>I have often worked as part of a team in my career. This teamwork includes helping others at checkouts,
                helping with a delivery, helping someone to get a trailer/ van out on time by helping them to load the
                trailer/ van, and also by communicating with others on the task I'm currently doing, to ensure that
                others can focus on another task. Most recently, when I'm tasked to do loading at my current job, Arla,
                I often find myself helping to finish a route by picking a couple of orders, allowing the colleague
                that's loading that route to complete the load as quickly as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="outside-work"> <!-- What I Do Outside Of Work -->
            <h2>What do I do outside of work?</h2>
            <p>I have 2 kids, so whenever I'm not at work, I usually look after my kids, taking them to football and
                ballet, and supporting them both in trying to improve themselves in their respective hobbies.</p>
            <p>As a seperated co-parent to my kids, I also like to spend time with my girlfriend whenever I don't have
                the kids, just relaxing and watching movies.</p>
            <p>I am also a massive football fan, supporting Manchester United for my entire life, so whenever I have the
                time, I like to try and fit in watching my team play. I also sometimes like to bring my son to my local
                football stadium, to watch the local team, St Albans City, play football. I really enjoy them father-son
                moments with my son, and hope to one day be able to take him to watch Manchester United play at Old
                Trafford.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="goals"> <!-- My Goals And Aspirations -->
            <h2>What are my goals?</h2>
            <p>For my next step, my goal is to just gain more experience in the world of Programming. If I can learn
                something new during this time of gaining experience, that'd be a bonus.</p>
            <p>Once I've started gaining some experience, and have gotten settled in with this career path, I would like
                to be able to start learning new things about the languages I already know, as well as learning a new
                language.</p>
            <p>The final goal of my career, is to work as a game designer. The whole reason I got into programming, and
                started a course, is because I fell in love with game creation. I discovered this love through the Unity
                Game Engine, and taught myself to code in C Sharp. As I wasn't 100% sure if I was coding as efficiently
                as I possibly could, I then decided to do a course, to make sure I can code as efficiently as possible.
            </p>
            <p>This final goal won't stop me from trying my best at whatever workplace I find myself in, as I believe
                that you should always try your hardest in whatever job you work at.</p>

        <div class="career"> <!-- What I've Done In My Career -->
            <h2>My career so far</h2>
            <div class="first-job"> <!-- Co-op -->
                <p>My working career started in 2013, just before I turned 16. This is the path I've made so far,
                    starting from then, and what I think will be useful for my way forward from them jobs.</p>
                <h3>July 2013 - March 2017</h3>
                <p>Starting from my Early career in 2013, I worked for Co-op food in London Colney. I started here doing
                    8
                    hours per week, whilst I studied Engineering in college. At the start of my career here, I used to
                    do
                    ambient date code checking, which was a very simple task of just checking the dates of specific
                    products
                    in the ambient section of the store. I was also required to help customers whenever they needed it
                    at
                    this time.</p>
                <p>At some point in 2014, I was then trained to work the tills, which is what I was doing most of the
                    time
                    when I worked from then until mid 2015. This included stocking the cigarette counter, making sure it
                    was
                    fully stocked for customers that wished to purchase cigarettes. At this time, since I was still only
                    16/17 at the time, I had to ask for authorization whenever a customer requested age restricted
                    products.
                    This part of the job required interacting with customers daily, dealing with refunds and complaints,
                    also taking on the responsibility of handling money too.</p>
                <p>When I left college in 2015, I decided it was time to start working full time. From there, I was
                    transferred to a shop in Welwyn Garden City, also taking a step up to Customer Team Leader, which
                    involved making sure staff had work to do, checking what we had in stock, taking in deliveries and
                    making sure the tills had the amount that was expected to be there. I was also expected to deal with
                    customer complaints professionally, using my knowledge of the store policies and promotions when
                    required.</p>
                <p>Early 2016, I then decided to move back to London Colney store. However, in order for me to keep my
                    Full
                    Time hours, I had to work at London Colney 3 days per week as a Customer Team Member, and How Wood 2
                    days per week as a Team Leader. My responsibility at London Colney had changed from working the
                    tills in
                    early 2015, to helping stock the shop and helping on the tills when required. This is where I stayed
                    until I decided to leave in March 2017.</p>
                <h3>Skills I think could be useful from this job</h3>
                <p>I think my later career in Co-op will be useful in future jobs, as I had alot more involvement with
                    customers, and helped my colleagues alot more in this time. At the same time, I think my till work
                    will still help going forward, as it made me realise that sometimes you need to ask for help when
                    you're unable to handle your current work load.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="second-job"> <!-- NFT Distribution/ EV Cargo Logistics -->
                <h3>March 2017 - June 2021</h3>
                <p>In March 2017, I started working for the Warehouse, NFT Distribution (later to be renamed EV Cargo
                    Logistics). I started this job in the ambient department, working night shift on picking until July
                    2017, where
                    I was transferred to the chilled department on the day shift.</p>
                <p>From July 2017 until June 2021, I worked in the Chilled department of NFT, and during my time there,
                    I had been trained on many different jobs. The first job I was trained in, was picking, which
                    involved working with my collagues in each grid to make sure each product went to the correct shop,
                    keeping the roll cages stacked nicely.</p>
                <p>The second job I was trained on in the chilled department, was goods in, which involved making sure
                    each product was seperated individually, and making sure the quantity recieved for each product was
                    correct, before sending it off to be picked by pickers. After being trained on goods in, I often
                    found myself helping others to seperate each product, so that they can count how much had been
                    recieved of each product.</p>
                <p>I had then been trained on Marshalling, which was the task I found myself doing the majority of the
                    time for the rest of my NFT career. This involved sorting each completed cage into locations, making
                    it easier for loaders to find these cages for loading. This task proved to be very difficult on busy
                    days, as there was only ever a maximum of 4 marshallers on shift at any one time, which would always
                    depend on the volume inbound.</p>
                <p>Another job that I occassionally found myself doing, is grid control, which involved keeping each of
                    my assigned grids clean and tidy for goods in to have more space to do their task, whilst also
                    allowing pickers to pick a product quicker. When there was nothing to do whilst on grid control, I
                    would find myself helping the goods in staff to make sure everything was completed as quickly as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>The final job I was trained on, was tipping. Tipping was another job from the goods in department,
                    which simply involved unloading trailers, and bringing each pallet to their assigned grids.</p>
                <p>During my time at NFT, I was trained to drive LLOP trucks to work in the ambient department when
                    required, and to do Marshalling in the chilled department. I was also trained on the PPT truck to
                    help with tipping. Towards the end of my career, I would also sometimes help loaders load their
                    trailers, by bringing roll cages to the bays that they needed to go to.</p>
                <h3>Skills I think could be useful from this job</h3>
                <p>The chilled department involved alot of teamwork, whether I was tasked with picking, goods in or
                    Marshalling. This, I believe, will help me greatly in working as part of a team in jobs moving
                    forward. Grid control also involved tasking people to pick specific pallets, which I believe helped
                    improve my leadership confidence, which was lacking before starting this job.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="third-job"> <!-- Sainsbury's -->
                <h3>January 2021 - March 2022</h3>
                <p>The start of 2021, marked the start of my career as an Online Delivery Driver for Sainsbury's in
                    London Colney. For the first 6 months of this job, I also worked for NFT Distribution. The reason
                    for this, is because I was being made redundant at NFT, so decided that I needed a job before the
                    redundancy took place.</p>
                <p>I started this job at 16 hours per week, however often found myself doing more than that to help with
                    the departments struggles until I moved to full time in July 2021.</p>
                <p>This job involved starting off checking the condition of the Van I was going to be using for the
                    shift, and using a sat nav device to guide me to each customers house for delivery.</p>
                <p>Quite often, I found myself being ahead of my scheduled time. Therefore, often finding myself being
                    early for some of my customers allocated time slots. Whenever this would happen, I would call up the
                    customer to ask if I could deliver earlier than their slot.</p>
                <p>There were also times where I found that I was late to the customer, but always found myself catching
                    up to my schedule quite quickly. Whenever I knew I was gonna be even a couple of minutes late to a
                    delivery, I would always call customers to make sure they knew I was on the way, and that I was
                    running a bit behind my schedule.</p>
                <p>My career at Sainsbury's wasn't always driving vans, however. Often, I would find myself staying in
                    the store, helping the online department load vans, or organising totes for each route.</p>
                <p>If I stayed at store, I would often find that I'd be helping on the shop floor with stacking shelves,
                    and even working the tills, if there wasn't anything to do in the online department during the
                    shift, or if there were too many people for the tasks that remained.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of my career at Sainsbury's, I got myself trained on the shopping side of the
                    department, which is what I ended up doing the majority of the time whenever I was on shift. This
                    could be quite a difficult task when the shop was open, as I had to also help customers whenever it
                    was required, as well as hit my pick target.</p>
                <h3>Skills I think could be useful from this job</h3>
                <p>As I quite often worked alone at the beginning of my career, I believe this will help going forward,
                    as often I had to try and figure out my own way, whenever I had to go to a newly built street, as
                    the provided sat nav wasn't always updated enought for these new builds.</p>
                <p>Like with previous jobs, I also had to do alot of teamwork whenever I was in store, with jobs like
                    loading and shelf stacking.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fourth-job"> <!-- Arla -->
                <h3>March 2022 - Present</h3>
                <p>My current job is with Arla Foods, currently working as a Work Coach in the pallets department.</p>
                <p>For the first 3 months of my career at Arla, when I was still a Warehouse Operative, I was tasked
                    with order picking, and found early on that
                    I would hit the required target daily. During this early portion of my career, I found myself
                    helping some of my colleagues to decide what product they should pick first for their order,
                    whenever they found themselves with a difficult order, something which I sometimes find myself doing
                    today sometimes.</p>
                <p>After my first 3 months, due to how hard I had worked for that probation period, I was given training
                    for the PPT trucks, which, around a month later, lead to being trained as a loader.</p>
                <p>Around a month after that, I found myself being offered the Work Coach job, which is my task today.
                    This is the same as a Warehouse Operative, however, I'm tasked with training new starters, and
                    anyone that's required to be trained on loading. It also enables me to challenge people on their
                    picks, if I feel their stacking is poor, if if I feel they've picked too much on their pallet.</p>
                <h3>Skills I think could be useful from this job</h3>
                <p>I often find myself today helping my colleagues out, whether it be by picking a specific order, given
                    to me by my supervisor, helping to load a trailer, or helping one of my picker colleagues restack a
                    pallet. Helping others out is something that I really enjoy doing, as it helps them get their job
                    done quicker, and in some cases, helps them understand what might've gone wrong.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="summary"> <!-- What I can provide from all previous jobs combined -->
                <h3>Takeaway</h3>
                <p>Throughout my career, I've found myself working as part of a team a lot. However none of this
                    teamwork was in a programming environment, based on previous experience, I know I'd be able to work
                    as part of a team on any project I might be assigned to.</p>
                <p>As well as this, there's also been many times where I've been assigned to work alone, which I know
                    that I'm more than capable of doing.</p>
                <p>Lastly, there's also been a few times during my working career where I've needed to ask for help. I
                    tend to be very confident in knowing what I can and can't do, especially in the world of
                    programming. I'm also not afraid to push my limits, but will always ask for help if I'm unable to
                    find what I'm looking for to help me progress with my task.</p>
